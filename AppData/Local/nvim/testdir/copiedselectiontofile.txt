# Lesson 5.2: MORE ON WRITING FILES

** To save the changes made to the text, type `:w`{vim} FILENAME. **

 1. Type `:!dir`{vim} to get a listing of your directory.
    You already know you must hit `<Enter>`{normal} after this.

 2. Choose a filename that does not exist yet, such as TEST.

 3. Now type:
~~~ cmd
        :w TEST
~~~
    (where TEST is the filename you chose.)

 4. This saves the current file under the name TEST.
    To verify this, type `:!dir`{vim} again to see your directory.

NOTE: If you were to exit Neovim and start it again with `nvim TEST`, the file
      would be an exact copy of the tutorial when you saved it.

 5. Now remove the file by typing:
~~~ cmd
        :!del TEST
~~~
# Lesson 5.3: SELECTING TEXT TO WRITE

** To save part of the file, type `v`{normal} motion `:w FILENAME`{vim}. **

 1. Move the cursor to this line.

 2. Press [v](v) and move the cursor to the fifth item below. Notice that the
    text is highlighted.

 3. Press the `:`{normal} character. At the bottom of the screen

        `:'<,'>`{vim}

    will appear.

 4. Type

        `w TEST`{vim}

    where TEST is a filename that does not exist yet. Verify that you see

        `:'<,'>w TEST`{vim}

    before you press `<Enter>`{normal}.

 5. Neovim will write the selected lines to the file TEST. Use `:!dir`{vim} to see it.
    Do not remove it yet! We will use it in the next lesson.

NOTE: Pressing [v](v) starts [Visual selection](visual-mode). You can move the cursor around to
      make the selection bigger or smaller. Then you can use an operator to
      do something with the text. For example, `d`{normal} deletes the text.
